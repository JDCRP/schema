At the time of Adolphe Schloss’ death in 1910, the collection numbered more than 330 paintings which were prominently displayed on the walls of his Parisian mansion at 38, avenue Henri-Martin. There were paintings from workshops in Delft, Haarlem, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, Antwerp, as well as Lyon and Venice. One could see in the glass-roofed gallery ornately-framed portraits, landscapes and still lifes juxtaposed with scenes from the Old and New Testaments. A network of European art dealers, chief among them François Kleinberger and Charles Sedelmeyer, supplied Adolphe Schloss with high-quality paintings previously acquired by collectors and dealers from the UK, Holland, France, Belgium and Tsarist Russia." .
